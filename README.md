## Features  
- **Voice Activation:** Trigger the assistant with the keyword `"Hey Sagar"`.  
- **Speech-to-Text:** Uses Google Speech Recognition to capture and process audio commands.  
- **AI-Powered Responses:** Processes commands and generates context-aware responses using the Groq API.  
- **Text-to-Speech:** Responds audibly using pyttsx3 for a natural voice experience.  
- **Web Automation:** Opens popular websites (e.g., Google, YouTube) and plays music links.  
- **Context Awareness:** Maintains conversation context for better interactions.

## Prerequisites  

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:  
```bash  
pip install pyaudio  
pip install SpeechRecognition  
pip install pyttsx3  
pip install groq  
```

## Setup and Configuration  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/SagarBiswas-MultiHAT/Spech_to_Spech_AI-Assistant.git 
   
   cd Spech_to_Spech_AI-Assistant 
   ```  

2. Install the required libraries (see prerequisites).  

3. Replace the `api_key` in the `aiProcess()` function with your Groq API key.  

4. Run the script:  
   ```bash  
   python main.py  
   ```

## How to Use  

1. **Start Listening:** Run the script, and the assistant waits for the activation phrase `"Hey Sagar"`.  

2. **Give Commands:** Speak commands like:  
   - "Open Google"  
   - "Play [song_name]"  
   - General queries for AI responses (e.g., "What's the weather?").  

3. **AI Response:** The assistant will process your command and provide a response or action audibly and visually.
